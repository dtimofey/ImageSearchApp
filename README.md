Images Search App

Run "npm install" to create the node_modules folder.
Run "npm start" to preview in the browser.

Short information about my final app (terrible english included for free).

It's a simple app for serching pictures by inputing a keyword in a form and pressing saerch button. I plan that there would be about 15 pictures in results, after clicking on one of them it will opens in large and also we will see a few information about picture and it's author.

04.07.21 (major changes) Added base folders and files for my final project "Connected" pixabay API Created const to made app to search exactly what we need Forced form to do not refresh page when we push search button

Functionality of this version of the app: Simple unstyled form where you can type any keyword ('dog' for example) and it will return an array of similar values from pixabay service.
